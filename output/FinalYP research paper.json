Inspite  of progress  in  monitoring  technologies, existing solutions frequently exhibit shortcomings  in precision, struggling to amalgamate various data sources or  effectively pinpoint the origins of pollution. This research  initiative seeks to fill these deficiencies by creating an artificial  intelligence-driven system that integrates satellite observations  and terrestrial sensor data to forecast air quality, ascertain  pollution sources, and monitor carbon credits through the  utilization of blockchain technology. Advanced machine  learning models guarantee proper spatial-temporal analysis  while responding in real-time to unexpected environmental  events, such as forest fires or industrial development. The  system will also have citizen engagement tools to receive AQI  alerts and file reports on pollution. By offering actionable  insights to its stakeholders and promoting sustainable practices,  the project hopes to enhance air quality management, support  public health, and balance the ecosystem.   Keywords— Air pollution, AI-driven air quality forecasting,  satellite and terrestrial data integration, blockchain for carbon  credits, spatial-temporal analysis, citizen engagement tools.  Introduction   Air pollution, which is the occurrence of harmful substances in  the air, has significant impacts on human health and the  environment. A number of studies have confirmed that air pollution  exposure is associated with a number of respiratory and  cardiovascular diseases, as well as mortality. In a bid to reduce the  negative impacts of air pollution, effective and timely monitoring  systems must be established.[1]  Traditional air quality monitoring networks typically use an  ensemble of ground-based sensors. Such networks, however, suffer  from limited spatial coverage and perhaps are not adequate in  describing the large extent of air pollution. Satellite remote sensing  offers a promising alternative with global coverage and capability to  assess air quality at high spatial and temporal resolution.  The recent advancements in artificial intelligence and machine  learning have been at the forefront in creating advanced models to  forecast air quality and detect causes of air pollution. By evaluating  large datasets that are collected from different sources, the models  can give valuable information regarding the causes of air pollution,  as well as the possible effects of different mitigation methods [2].  A. Data Sources and Integration   Satellites, along with ground sensors, are of great advantages  in air quality monitoring. MODIS and Sentinel are satellite  data sources that cover the whole world. This satellite data  can monitor pollutant concentrations over a significant area  of a geographic location, especially for regions with difficult  access. The main drawback of using satellite data is that it  does not provide spatial resolution. This limitation is  overcome by integrating data from ground sensors that  provide accurate, real-time measurements of pollutants such  as PM2.5, NO₂, and CO₂. The combination of these two  sources of data enhances the predictive accuracy of the  system by combining the wide coverage of satellites with the  local accuracy of ground-based sensors [6], [7], [8].  B. Pollution Source Identification  The identification of pollution sources constitutes an essential  component of air quality management. Conventional  methodologies depend on stationary monitoring stations or  indirect assessments based on gradients of pollutant  concentration. Artificial intelligence approaches, especially  those involving machine learning algorithms, can offer  enhanced understanding by examining spatial-temporal  patterns present in the data.    Using algorithms such as Temporal Graph Neural Networks  (TGNNs), the system can now classify sources separately— including industrial emissions, vehicular pollutants, and a  category of natural sources like wildfires. Moreover, beyond  its capability of source classification, these advanced AI  models are highly adaptive to changes, such as novel  industrial setups, by predicting the probable consequences on  AQI based on historical data combined with current  environmental settings [9], [10], [11].    C. Carbon Credit System  The carbon credit mechanism is designed to motivate the  industries to reduce their emissions by offering financial  rewards for every ton of carbon reduction. This is done  through the purchase of carbon credits, which represent one  metric ton of CO₂ equivalent emissions that are reduced or  removed. The mechanism tracks carbon credits emanating  from a variety of mitigation activities including renewable  energy, forest conservation and reforestation.  It provides transparency, verifiability, and unchanging  documentation of carbon credit transactions through  blockchain technology. Such features ensure the authenticity  of credits and prevent double counting and encourage  accountability and motivate the firm for sustainable practices  [12], [13], [14].  D.  Citizen Engagement Platform  The citizen engagement platform, designed for real-time AQI  updates, empowers a community that can actively participate   in pollution monitoring. Citizens have the facility to report  polluting events, such as smoke arising from forest fire or  effluents from plants, through uploading photographs and  videos. Citizen-generated data is really important because it  captures all those polluting events missed by other sensors or  satellites due to delays in their detection. This service  provides an easy interface in local air quality monitoring,  issuing notices with changes in AQI and provides  comprehension concerning the impact of different air  pollutants on human health as well as the environment. The  platform is a critical constituent in community-driven  environmental governance [15], [16].  E. Event Responsiveness  The system can react to an unplanned event, like forest fires,  industrial accidents, or unusual traffic patterns, by processing  data in real time and making instant forecasts of rising Air  Quality Index (AQI) levels. Machine learning algorithms are  continuously engaged in processing incoming data to detect  anomalies and forecast potential rises in air pollution levels.  For instance, it can forecast the way the AQI will increase  based on particulate matter concentration levels in the air and  its dispersion pattern while a forest fire is occurring.  Likewise, new industrial developments can be tested based  on their likely effects on air quality, thus allowing local  municipalities to act preventively before the pollution level  reaches perilous heights [17], [18].  II. RELATED WORK  Air pollution prediction and source identification of pollution  have moved a long way since simple statistical models to  sophisticated methods with artificial intelligence. The early  generic methods utilized rule-based models and static  regression methods to predict pollution levels based on  historical data and pre-set thresholds [13]. Although such  models worked in certain situations, they were incapable of  responding to dynamic environmental conditions and could  not perform real-time analysis and forecasting.    Emerging developments in machine learning and deep  learning techniques have made it feasible to build more  complex models for air quality forecasting. The models use  satellite  observations,  surface  measurements,  and  meteorological variables to improve accuracy [4]. Moreover,  sensor fusion technologies, which combine data from  different sources, have enhanced the accuracy of forecasts  significantly by removing inconsistencies in satellite and  surface observations.    Apart from that, advanced feature extraction techniques like  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent  Neural Networks (RNNs) can be employed in contemporary  artificial intelligence algorithms to learn the spatial and  temporal patterns of pollution [2]. Causes of pollution, i.e.,  industrial, vehicular emissions, and natural factors like forest  fires, can be identified. Moreover, reinforcement learning has  been studied for enhancing pollution control and to provide  regulatory policies [1].  Another important trend is the deployment of real-time air  quality monitoring and alert notification systems. Websites  and mobile applications now provide citizens with data  related to the air quality index (AQI), thus enabling them to  take preventive action [10]. In addition, participatory sensing  approaches enable citizens to report cases of pollution,  including industrial infringements or poisonous discharges,  thus supplementing environmental monitoring efforts [6].  Carbon credit systems have also become prominent as an  incentive system for ensuring environmental balance. AI- based models now take a central role in tracking emissions,  enforcing environmental regulations, and enabling credit  transfer between industries [7]. The combination of  predictive analytics with real-time monitoring has made it  possible to create more flexible and dynamic pollution  control systems.    The development of artificial intelligence-based air quality  prediction and source apportionment greatly increases the  sustainability and efficiency of environmental management  systems. Utilizing novel technologies, upcoming studies aim  at developing these models into more accurate, scalable, and  pragmatic models for real-world applications.[16]  III. OBJECTIVES  A.

Discussion Experimental evidence attests to the fact that AI- based air quality monitoring is extremely effective when  complemented with satellite-ground sensor fusion, deep  learning,  blockchain,  and  crowdsourcing.  Model  Performance: Stable low error rates for the TGNN model  attest to the fact that it can function well enough to predict  AQI even in complicated city scenarios. Transfer learning- based adaptation predictions are promising directions for  future enhancements. Industry Compliance and Transparency:  Carbon credit system via blockchain functioned well in  keeping industries in check. In reality, implementation would  require, nonetheless, policy-level cooperation with green  bodies. Scalability and Real-World Application The  framework is scalable to other cities and firms. Integration of  real-time data allows adaptive feedback to surge in pollution  (e.g., industrialization, wildfires).  Conclusion  This project proposes an AI-driven air quality forecasting and  source identification of pollution system based on satellite- ground sensor fusion, deep learning, blockchain-based carbon  credit trading, and citizen engagement to develop an end-to- end environmental monitoring system. Temporal Graph  Neural Networks (TGNN) for AQI prediction, K-Means  clustering for hotspot detection, and MQ135 sensors for  emission verification have been proven to be highly efficient  and accurate for pollution monitoring. The blockchain-based  carbon credit system ensures transparent emission trading, and  industries are compelled to adopt green practices. Moreover,  the citizen engagement system ensures real-time reporting and  awareness, and pollution control becomes participatory.  Although there are limitations in data integration, scalability,  and policy adherence, the system is an adaptive, scalable, and  efficient mechanism for environmental monitoring. This work  lays the groundwork for data-driven environmental policy and  green urban planning, enabling the creation of smarter,  cleaner, and healthier cities.  F. Future Enhancement  In the years to come, the system can be developed into a  smartphone app with Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual  Reality (VR) capabilities so that people can simply wave their  smartphone camera around to be presented with real-time  data on pollutant levels, AQI, and prevailing emission  sources in the area. The interactive visualization will enable  more public awareness and engagement by rendering air  quality information more accessible and easier to understand.  Moreover, the integration of edge computing with IoT  sensors can enable real-time on-device AQI prediction,  minimizing cloud dependency and system latency. Another  major innovation is the use of AI-based adaptive modelling,  wherein the system constantly improves its learning from  new environmental patterns in real-time to achieve maximum  prediction accuracy. Additionally, scaling up carbon credit  trading using blockchain to an international platform can  enable increased industrial involvement, inspiring cross- border sustainable practices. Finally, the incorporation of  drone-sensed air quality monitoring can enable high- resolution mapping of pollution, enabling authorities to  monitor emissions across different altitudes and in remote  locations, further enhancing environmental surveillance and  compliance.
